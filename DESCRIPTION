Description: Provides a calculator for the two-dimensional clinical Disease Activity 
    index for Psoriatic Arthritis (TwoDcDAPSA), a principal component-derived measure 
    that complements the conventional clinical DAPSA score. The TwoDcDAPSA captures 
    residual variation in patient-reported outcomes (pain and patient global assessment) 
    and joint counts (swollen and tender) after adjusting for standardized cDAPSA using 
    natural spline coefficients derived from published models. Residuals are 
    standardized and combined with fixed principal component loadings to yield a 
    continuous PROs-Joint Contrast (PJC) score and quartile groupings. The package 
    applies pre-specified coefficients and loadings to new datasets but does not 
    estimate spline models or principal components itself.

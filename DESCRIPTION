Description: Provides a calculator for the two-dimensional clinical Disease Activity
    index for Psoriatic Arthritis (TwoDcDAPSA), a principal component-derived measure
    that complements the conventional clinical DAPSA score. TwoDcDAPSA captures
    residual variation in patient-reported outcomes (pain and patient global assessment)
    and joint counts (swollen and tender) after adjusting for standardized cDAPSA using
    natural spline coefficients derived from published models. Residuals are
    standardized and combined with fixed principal component loadings to yield two
    continuous component scores: the PROs-Joint Contrast (PJC) and the
    Swollen–Tender joints Contrast (STC), along with quartile-based groupings
    (including optional combined quartile groupings). The package applies pre-specified
    coefficients, residual standardization, and loadings to new datasets but does not
    estimate spline models or principal components itself.
